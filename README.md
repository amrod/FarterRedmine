Faster Redmine
==============

Change the Status of a Redmine Issue without having to click first on the Edit link, change the Status, and then click on the Submit button. This extension puts a dropdown right on the main Issue view, and changing the selection immediately updates the Issue. You can choose to refresh the page on each Issue update in the extension's settings.

Features:
---------
 - Insert a dropdown in the Status field of Issues. Selecting a status updates the Issue immediately.
 - Propagate the same status selection to the parent task, if enabled in the settings (enabled by default).
 - Updates happen in the background, so no need to reload the page.

Attention
---------
To use this extension, your Redmine application must have API-style authentication enabled. You or your administrator can do this by checking Enable REST API in Administration -> Settings -> Authentication
